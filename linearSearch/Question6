Check whether an element is present in an array or not (linear search):

Problem: We're given an array of numbers and a specific number called the "target." Our task is to determine whether this target number is present within our array or not.

Approach: Here's a simple way we could solve this problem. We'll start at the beginning of our array and check each element one by one to see if it's the same as our target number. This process is known as linear search - think of it as taking a magnifying glass and going down the line of our array, examining each number closely. If we find a match, we can immediately say that the target is indeed present in the array. If we get to the end of the array without finding the target, then it's safe to say the target is not present in the array.
